Enthusiastic and determined Junior Fullstack Developer with an interest in Javascript and a management and medical background. I have a fondness for logic, tinkering and visual design, and my new-found affinity for web development has allowed me to reconnect with these passions. I wish to continue learning and to grow in a creative and collaborative environment.

## Skills
#### Problem solving
I'm a 'deep diver' who, when confronted with a new problem, pauses to carefully think things through before acting. I aim initially to figure out whether I already know enough to resolve an issue, and, if not, to identify which gaps in my understanding need to be filled, how to fill them, and in what order.

#### Fast Learner
Starting Makers Academy, I had minimal experience of object orientated programming and had never coded in Ruby or JavaScript. After an intense 16 weeks I found I was comfortable in both languages and had developed the skills and frameworks to pick up new technologies/languages quickly.

#### Communication and Teamwork
<ul>
    <li>At Dental View, our team of 5 was overseeing the activity in all of our 4 locations in Bucharest and a total of 60 employees from the Medical Department. As a result, I'm very comfortabl working in a cross-functional team and prioritizing workload according to demand.</li>
    <li>In my previous roles, I have been involved in running and managing several projects, including my private practice. I am capable of gathering requirements and prioritising tasks in order to deliver value iteratively.</li> 
    <li>In the team projects at Makers, I have practised my Agile skills with productive stand-ups, efficient splitting of tasks and daily retros to reflect on pros and cons. Thanks to this little set of rules, I helped my teams to functioning like a well oiled machine.</li>
